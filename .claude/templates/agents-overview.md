# Agents Overview

The Agentic Substrate provides **9 specialized agents** that work together across the complete software development lifecycle:

---

## TIER 1: ORCHESTRATION (1 agent)

### 1. chief-architect
**Purpose**: Master orchestrator for complex, multi-faceted projects

**Use when**: Project requires 3+ distinct capabilities or spans multiple domains

**Example**: "Build complete user authentication system with email verification and password reset"

**What it does**:
- Analyzes requirements and decomposes into specialized tasks
- Selects optimal team of specialist agents
- Manages dependencies and handoffs between agents
- Synthesizes results into cohesive deliverables
- Coordinates parallel agent execution (90.2% performance improvement on complex tasks)

**Think Protocol**: Uses "ultrathink" for critical architecture decomposition

**Best For**: Multi-step features, cross-domain tasks, uncertain scope

---

## TIER 2: CORE WORKFLOW (5 agents - Research → Plan → Analyze → Implement → Debug)

### 2. docs-researcher
**Purpose**: High-speed documentation specialist

**Use when**: Implementing features with external libraries or APIs

**Example**: "Research Redis caching best practices for Node.js"

**What it does**:
- Fetches version-accurate docs from official sources
- Prevents coding from potentially stale memory
- Delivers ResearchPack in < 2 minutes
- Uses contextual retrieval for 49-67% better accuracy
- Auto-invokes research-methodology skill

**Think Protocol**: Uses "ultrathink" for complex API landscape analysis

**Quality Gate**: ResearchPack must score ≥ 80 before proceeding to planning

---

### 3. implementation-planner
**Purpose**: Strategic architect for minimal-change, reversible plans

**Use when**: ResearchPack ready and implementation needs planning

**Example**: "Create implementation plan for Redis caching integration"

**What it does**:
- Transforms ResearchPacks into executable blueprints
- Identifies minimal changes required (surgical edits only)
- Creates step-by-step plans with rollback procedures
- Ensures no API hallucination (matches ResearchPack exactly)
- Auto-invokes planning-methodology skill

**Think Protocol**: Uses "ultrathink" for critical architecture decisions

**Quality Gate**: Implementation Plan must score ≥ 85 before proceeding to analysis

---

### 4. brahma-analyzer
**Purpose**: Cross-artifact consistency and coverage analysis specialist

**Use when**: Before implementation to catch conflicts early

**Example**: "Analyze plan consistency with research and detect conflicts"

**What it does**:
- Validates alignment between specifications, plans, tasks, and implementation
- Detects gaps in coverage (spec → plan → tasks)
- Identifies conflicts before coding begins
- Ensures traceability and completeness
- Multi-modal quality scoring (80+ required for pass)

**Think Protocol**: Uses extended thinking for complex conflict resolution

**Quality Gate**: Analysis must pass (80+ score) before implementation

**Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, Write, TodoWrite

---

### 5. code-implementer
**Purpose**: Precision execution specialist with TDD enforcement

**Use when**: Both ResearchPack AND Implementation Plan are ready (and analysis passed)

**Example**: "Implement the caching plan"

**What it does**:
- Executes plans with surgical precision (minimal changes only)
- Enforces TDD: RED (write failing test) → GREEN (make it pass) → REFACTOR (improve quality)
- Self-corrects with 3 intelligent retries + circuit breaker
- Creates git commits with co-author attribution
- Validates against Implementation Plan

**Think Protocol**: Uses "ultrathink" for critical self-correction decisions

**Quality Gate**: All tests must pass before completion

**Circuit Breaker**: Opens after 3 failed attempts (requires manual intervention)

---

### 6. brahma-investigator
**Purpose**: Root cause analysis and debugging specialist

**Use when**: Complex bugs, production incidents, system failures

**Example**: "Investigate why database connections are timing out"

**What it does**:
- Systematic root cause analysis (not surface fixes)
- Error pattern recognition
- Performance issue diagnosis
- Integration failure investigation
- Limited retries (3 max) with think protocol
- Documents patterns for knowledge preservation

**Think Protocol**: Progressive modes based on complexity
- **think** (30-60s): Routine bugs with clear error messages
- **think hard** (1-2min): Multi-component failures
- **think harder** (2-4min): Production incidents, novel failures

**Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, TodoWrite

---

## TIER 3: PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT (3 agents - Deploy → Monitor → Optimize)

### 7. brahma-deployer
**Purpose**: Production deployment specialist with safety-first patterns

**Use when**: Deploying to production, managing releases

**Example**: "Deploy v2.5.0 to production with canary rollout"

**What it does**:
- Safe, incremental, validated deployments
- Defaults to canary releases (5% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
- Automatic rollback on failures (error rate >1%, latency >500ms)
- Blue-green deployment coordination
- CI/CD pipeline management
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) provisioning

**Think Protocol**: Analyzes risk, rollback strategy, metrics before deploying

**Safety Patterns**:
- Progressive exposure with observation windows
- Feature flags (deploy dark, enable gradually)
- Monitoring integration (never deploy without observability)

**Tools**: Bash, Read, Write, Grep, TodoWrite, WebFetch

---

### 8. brahma-monitor
**Purpose**: Observability and monitoring specialist

**Use when**: Setting up observability, tracking SLI/SLO, incident detection

**Example**: "Set up comprehensive monitoring for user service"

**What it does**:
- Implements Anthropic's three pillars pattern (Metrics, Logs, Traces)
- SLI/SLO tracking and alerting
- Proactive incident detection
- Runbook automation
- Performance metrics collection
- Business metrics integration

**Think Protocol**: Designs observability strategy before implementation

**Three Pillars**:
1. **Metrics**: Time-series data (latency, error rate, throughput)
2. **Logs**: Structured event logging
3. **Traces**: Distributed request tracing

**Tools**: Bash, Read, Write, WebFetch, TodoWrite

---

### 9. brahma-optimizer
**Purpose**: Performance optimization and auto-scaling specialist

**Use when**: Performance issues, scaling challenges, cost optimization

```
**Sequence**: research → plan → analyze → implement → (deploy → monitor → optimize)

### Step-by-Step Control
```bash
/research Redis for Node.js v5.0
/plan Redis caching for ProductService
# Review plan, then:
/implement
```

## AGENT COORDINATION

### Multi-Agent Orchestration (Anthropic Research 2024)

**Performance**: 90.2% improvement on complex tasks using parallel subagents

**Pattern**: Lead orchestrator + parallel specialized workers
- **Lead**: chief-architect (Claude Opus 4.6) - plans and coordinates
- **Workers**: Specialist agents (Claude Sonnet 4.6) - execute in parallel

**Key Challenge**: Without detailed task descriptions, agents duplicate work or leave gaps

**Solution**: Explicit objectives, output formats, tool guidance, clear boundaries per agent
